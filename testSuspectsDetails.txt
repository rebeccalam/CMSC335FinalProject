                Caution: <p>Francisco Molina-Neave is being sought for assault and the prohibited use of a weapon. Reports in this case allege the following: On July 5, 1997, Francisco Molina-Neave and his girlfriend attended a holiday party in the Denver Metro area. While driving home from the party, Molina-Neave, who was seated in the front passenger seat, began punching his girlfriend as she was driving. She stopped the car and pulled over. Molina-Neave got out and walked around to the driver’s side of the car where he continued to beat his girlfriend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The assault continued until a passer-by showed up and ran over to the girlfriend. Molina-Neave then fled the area. The passer-by flagged down a vehicle occupied by additional witnesses who reportedly saw the beating. The passer-by asked the witnesses in the car to attempt to locate the suspect. They agreed to help and spotted Molina-Neave a short distance away. They told Molina-Neave to stop and that they had called the police. The suspect fled down an alley as police arrived. While setting up the perimeter the police heard two gunshots fired from the alley where the suspect was last seen. The gunshots were fired by two different guns. The officers observed the witness vehicle speed out of the alley. The witnesses were screaming that the same suspect, along with another Hispanic male, had allegedly shot at them and their vehicle. One of the occupants in the vehicle was screaming that she had been shot as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On January 21, 1999, a jury found Francisco Molina-Neave guilty on charges of first degree assault, attempted first degree assault, prohibited use of a weapon, and third degree assault. Molina-Neave fled from the courtroom as the verdict was read. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. On May 17, 2006, Francisco Molina-Neave was arrested on the warrant from Denver in San Antonio, Texas. He refused extradition, and a Texas court allowed him to post bond pending his extradition appeal. The suspect failed to appear and was arrested in mid-May of 2007. The Texas court set his bond for one million dollars. Molina-Neave posted the bond and was released. His appeal was denied on October 4, 2007, and he fled again. On March 13, 2008, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Molina-Neave, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>

                Caution: <p>George Edward Wright is wanted for his involvement in a series of crimes dating back to 1962.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On November 23, 1962, Wright and an accomplice, who was arrested, shot and killed the owner of a gas station in Wall, New Jersey, during the commission of a robbery at the business.  On December 13, 1962, Wright was indicted for the murder.  He entered a plea of "no defense", and was sentenced to prison for a period of 15 to 30 years.  Then, on August 22, 1970, Wright escaped from the New Jersey State Prison in Leesburg, New Jersey.  The State of New Jersey issued an arrest warrant for Wright after he was charged with escape and, on August 26, 1970, a federal arrest warrant was issued for Wright in the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, Trenton, New Jersey, after he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid confinement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On July 31, 1972, Wright, and others who were arrested, hijacked a Delta Airlines jet en route from Detroit, Michigan, to Miami, Florida.  The hijackers used handguns and made threats against the passengers on the plane.  At the time, Wright used the name Reverend Larry Burgess, wore the clothing of a cleric, and carried a Bible.  He used a gun concealed in the Bible to confront the aircraft's pilot and crew.  After a ransom was delivered to the hijackers, the passengers were released in Miami.  The hijackers and the plane's crew then flew to Boston, Massachusetts, refueled, picked up an international navigator, and flew to Algiers.  The plane and ransom were then returned to the United States Government, while the hijackers remained free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On September 26, 2011, after more than 40 years as a fugitive, Wright was arrested in Portugal.  He was released from custody in October of 2011, and remains in Portugal, where he continues to live.  Wright is the sole hijacker to remain at large.</p>

                Age: 81
                Scars and Marks: Wright has scars on his head, left cheek, and near his right eye.  He also has a burn scar on his upper left forearm.

                Details: <p>On May 22, 2023, at approximately 1:30 a.m., a female passerby saw a silver Chevrolet Aveo with black tape on the middle of the bumper and blue tape on the sides of the bumper. The vehicle was parked in a remote part of West Valley City, Utah, with its flashers turned on; a man was standing outside the vehicle holding jumper cables. The victim’s dash camera captured the man and is described as possibly White or Hispanic with a thick beard.  He was wearing a yellow shirt overtop of a long-sleeved, white shirt, and a beanie. The video stopped at that point, but the victim also noted that the man had a tattoo on the webbing of his right hand. The female exited her vehicle and the man pulled out a black handgun. He told her to shut up and get in the car. She sat in the car, and he struck her. He tore her shirt open, then put zip ties on her arms. He was going to put another clear industrial strength zip tie on her arms and set the gun on her. She grabbed the gun, threw it, and was able to escape in her vehicle.</p>

These charges relate to the alleged actions by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to target Iranian dissidents.

The United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Bazghandi twice for his alleged role in lethal targeting and assassination plots against enemies of Iran. Bazghandi is alleged to have been in communication with the murder-for-hire network and allegedly monitored the victim and the effort to murder the victim.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>On July 24, 2024, at approximately 3 p.m., a group of individuals, including suspects #1 and #2, vandalized and damaged government property at Union Station located at 24 Columbus Circle NE in Washington, D.C.  Additionally, suspect #4 attacked a USPP officer who was attempting to arrest a protestor.</p>
