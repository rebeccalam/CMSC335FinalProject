Witnesses reported her ex-boyfriend following Sanders out of her place of work the last night she was seen. Sanders is described as 5’4”, 115 pounds, having auburn hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a black jumper, black panty hose, rose color long sleeve collared shirt, white shoes, gold watch with a black leather band, gold earrings, and a diamond butterfly ring.
